Collect PowerBeam M2 data and put it in a database

# Update
Use the javascript version for more data/better support: https://github.com/jrcichra/ubnt-scraper.
This code still works but only keys off what is available from the undocumented api. The javascript edition logs in to your powerbeam and scrapes the javascript values.
